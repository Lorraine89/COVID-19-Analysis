Title Notes,,,,,,,
1,"Source: Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), COVID-19 epidemiological reports, with contribution from Provincial/Territorial Ministries of Health. For more information about this dataset please see the website: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/13260002.",,,,,,
2,"Given that the COVID-19 pandemic is rapidly evolving, these data are considered preliminary. The data published by Statistics Canada only account for those where a detailed case report was provided by the provincial or territorial jurisdiction to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). Statistics Canada’s detailed preliminary confirmed cases will not match the total case reporting done at the provincial and territorial levels which are reported daily by each jurisdiction and compiled by the PHAC.  The discrepancy is due to delays associated with the submission of the detailed information, its capture and coding. Hence, Statistics Canada’s file on detailed case reporting is a subset of the total counts reported by the health authorities across Canada.",,,,,,
3,Confirmed cases are laboratory confirmed cases for which a case report form has been received by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) from provincial or territorial partners.,,,,,,
4,"On November 26th 2020, the data table 13-10-0781-01 of detailed confirmed cases from the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) was replaced by a direct-download data file available at the website: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/13260003.",,,,,,
5,"On July 9th 2021, no updates were made except for the addition of new cases.",,,,,,
6,"The file may include some cases for which all of the information is missing, either because no information is available for them or because information is under review. These cases have been kept on the file to reflect a more accurate count of total COVID-19 cases in Canada even though there is no information available on those cases at this point.",,,,,,
